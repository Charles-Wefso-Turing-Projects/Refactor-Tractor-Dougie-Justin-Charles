## Project Overview

  In this project we worked with another developer's codebase to create an app that allows a user to find and save recipes, as well as getting directions to make the recipe. A user can also search the recipes by name, ingredient, or tag.

  A user is greeted and a display of recipes is presented.

  A recipe can be saved to a user's Favorite Recipe page. The view can then select that tab to view and search that list.

  The user can do the same with recipes to make.

  By using the search bar, a user can filter recipes by name, ingredient, or tag.

  By selecting a recipe, a user can see directions, as well as the cost of ingredients to make the specific recipe.
